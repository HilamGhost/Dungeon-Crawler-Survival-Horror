Story

Back story:
Centuries ago, a disease emerged from a small town in the middle of the forest. A disease that not only destroyed the body, but also the mind. It clinged on to anything that had living cells in its system. Effects of the disease were brutal,it disformed the body of the host, killed the mind and gave them the urge to feed on blood and flesh. It brought chaos all around the continent and millions suffered from it over the course of years. 
In the end, a group of cultists managed to seal it deep in the soil far away from all cities, thus ending the crisis.


This is where the main story takes place, “The Shuttered Land”
A long time after the disease is forgotten, a cult bought this land and they’ve been using it as a place for the cult members to accommodate and perform rituals to re-activate the ancient disease. They believe the disease was sent by god and is the only way for mankind’s salvation. (The only way to evolve into higher beings.) 

After years of practice and many failed attempts to perform the final ritual, they successfully release the disease from its prison and unleash its horrors.

The character we play as is Matthew, a member of the cult living with his little sister. Matthew started to question the actions of the cult a long time ago. The sacrifices, murders and the innocent people they slaughtered in the name of god. He carries the burden of these with him everyday.

After the final ritual is successfully performed, a group of members are too scared to continue and want to end the crisis before it's too late. They imprison the head of the cult that started this and prepeared to perform a counter ritual to seal the disease back in its eternal prison. 

The way to do this is to sacrifice the youngest female who was involved in the releasing of the disease and using her blood as a lock. (Children and women are considered to have a pure heart in their religion.) So they capture Matthew’s sister and bring her to the cathedral for the ritual.

Matthew wants the cult and himself to suffer for the things they’ve done. The guilt he carries with him is too big and he regrets everything. The only thing he wants is to keep his innocent sister out of this.

This is where the story starts. They capture our sister and we go after them in the middle of the disease outbreak, trying to survive, managing resources, fighting the disformed and meeting other survivors.
